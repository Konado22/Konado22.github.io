                <p className="p-10 text-pretty text-2xl indent-4">Hello and welcome to my Portfolio. I have been a student in the Computer Science Program
                    for roughly 2 1/2 years. Prior to attending SNHU (Southern New Hampshire University)
                    I completed a full-stack web development bootcamp offered through DU (University of Denver).
                    I have always enjoyed problem solving and found through these experiences my desire to create
                    applications and technology using the skills I have developed. I deeply enjoy creating dynamic interfaces and modular code that can be utilized
                    in front and back end development.
                </p>
                <p className="p-10">As I look towards the future of my career I aim to utilize the skills
                    developed within the BSCS program with emphasis in cybersecurity. Desires include becoming
                    a full-stack or front-end engineer. Utilizing skills in various languages, storage options, and
                    understanding the role of myself and others in cybersecurity I believe I truly have a solid
                    foundation to become a very capable developer with significant understanding of security implementation
                    and policies as well as their importance. As I am approaching the end of my bachelor degree program, I am actively looking for any opportunities
                    within the field of computer science and hope to continue developing my understanding of various current technologies in the industry.
