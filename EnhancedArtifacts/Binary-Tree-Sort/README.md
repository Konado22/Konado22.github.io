# Algorithms and Data Structures: cpp-data-sort <br/>

## Description

## Goals
This projects aim was an enhancement of previous work completed in CS-300. In this course we learned about various data structure in C++ and characteristics of these structures. The final project for this course was to create a data structure to store data read from an external CSV file. By creating this data structure and implementing the methodology to iterate through it, we also were tasked with justifying our descision to include the specific data structure we chose. Upon reflection and enhancements of this artifact I have transitioned to a binary tree structure rather than a standard vector. Below I have provided a list of enhancements performed to the artifact in line with course objectives that best showcases my work within data structures and algorithms within the SNHU computer science program.
<ul>
  <li>Transition from vector to Binary Tree</li>
  <li>Implmement functionality to iterate through tree</li>
  <li>Include parser file to create objects</li>
  <li>Build functionality to measure time performance of the programs execution</li>
</ul>

## Reflection

I had orginally chosen to implement a vector for the final project submission for this course. Iteration of a vector was easy to implement and was very linear in terms of methodology to iterate over and through the values within the stored vector. To demonstrate an understanding of data structures and algorithms I did want to implmeent a binary tree data structure. Though methodology constructed we can get faster computing times through the tree than we can with vectors. By showcasing the algorithms needes to pre and post sort the tree and explain the logic supporting the descision I demonstrate a solid understanding of data structures, their benefits, their hinderences, as well as a demonstration of course objectives.
