# Software Design and Engineering: Traveler (NextJS) <br/>

## Description
This application was originally created in Full-Stack development I. It allowed us the learn the process of converting traditional html webpages into dynamic single-page applications. The Traveler final project that was submitted was a MERN stack application. MongoDB was implemented for storage of the trips as well as users within the system that would need login permission for administrative purposes. 
## Goals
The goals of enhancements for this application revolved around the implementation of current and different technologies. There are many frameworks that exist within the industry and are constantly involving. I wanted to provide myself a challenge and opted for reimagining this application with a different stack. NextJS is a very current version of react, which is the framework I had previously utilized in my time at full-stack development bootcamp. However, NextJS had taken some of these previous concepts, similarly shared by Angular, and implemented further changes to the dynamic of the framework. SPA's provide the most dynamic experience to users as well as a fast loading and flexible application. By also integrating TailwindCSS for the styling of the react components and pages, I am able to implement inline styling similar to 3rd party libraries such as Bootstrap or Material-UI. By implementing dynamic and user-central ideaology is design of this application it is both reactive and mobile-friendly as well. This strongly embodies the traits that a Software Design and Engineering artifact should embody.
Below I have provided a list of ehancements performed to create this application.<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Implement NextJS framework</li>
  <li>Use built-in font and inline stylings of TailwindCSS</li>
  <li>Implement intelligent routing through NextJS routing</li>
  <li>Design reusable components to use in application pages</li>
  <li>Implement file structure and naming conventions in line with best practices</li>
  <li>integrate new versions of pages in NextJS rather than </li>
</ul>
